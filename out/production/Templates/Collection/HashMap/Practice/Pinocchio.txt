Pinocchio:
A long time ago, there was a man who made puppets.
His name was Geppetto.
He lived with his cat and his goldfish.
“I want a child,” he said to himself.
“I want someone to talk to.”

One day he found some wood in the forest.
He decided to make a puppet.
He worked very hard.
When he finished, he was pleased.
The puppet was a beautiful wooden boy.

“I will call him Pinocchio,” he said.
“He is a beautiful puppet,
but I want him to be alive!”

A fairy heard Geppetto.
She waved her magic wand
and touched Pinocchio.
“Live, Pinocchio,” she said.
“Be a good boy and do
what your father tells you.”

Then she heard a noise.
It came from a box on the table.
Jiminy Cricket was in the box.
The fairy said,
“You must be Pinocchio’s friend.
You must tell him what is right
and what is wrong.”

Geppetto woke up the next morning
and he saw that Pinocchio was alive.
He was very happy.

“Pinocchio!” he said,
“You are alive!
You are wooden,
but I love you.
You are my son!”

But Pinocchio was a silly boy.
When Geppetto or Jiminy Cricket tried to help him,
he didn’t listen.
He hated school and he was very bad at lessons.

“School’s silly!” he shouted.
“I don’t want to go to school.”

The winter was very cold.
Geppetto gave Pinocchio some warm clothes
and books for school.
Then he worked all day and all night.
He was very cold and tired.
Pinocchio saw this and he felt sad.

“I will come home after school
and help my father,” he said.
